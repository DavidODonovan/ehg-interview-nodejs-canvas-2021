## Colour Thing

This app displays a very long image that contains 32,768 discrete colours.

The app traverses the image in 30 second loops.

The image is created using a simple Node.js app that leverages the 'canvas' package.

The front end was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

To create image and launch app:

code ```

  npm run dev

```;
